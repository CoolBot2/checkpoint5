1/Basic Concepts:
a.  +plaintext: data that can be read und understood by humans or machines
	+ciphertext: data that has been encrypted to render it unintelligible
	+encryption: the process of altering data using algorithm render it directly unintelligible to humans or machines.
	+decryption: the process of rendering encrypted data back to plaintext
b. symmetric cryptography uses a single key for encryption and decryption whereas asymmetric cryptography uses two keys: a public key and a private key
c. goals of cryptography:
	+integrity
	+confidentiality
	+non repudiation

2/Symmetric Key cryptography:
	a,b,c. see script1 and script2 and script3

3/Practical application
	a,b. view script4 and script5
	c. digital signature: A digital signature is a cryptographic technique used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a digital message or document. It provides a way to ensure that the sender of a message is who they claim to be and that the message has not been tampered with during transmission.
		role of digital signature: Digital signatures play a crucial role in securing digital communication, ensuring that messages are not only protected against tampering but also verifying the identity of the sender. They are widely used in various applications such as email communication, software distribution, and online transactions to establish trust and security.
